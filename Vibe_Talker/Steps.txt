python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

1. First step, we have to access the mic  of user
   
   https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/
   https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition/blob/master/examples/microphone_recognition.py
   
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   pip install PyAudio

  import speech_recognition as sr

   def main():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
         r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=1)
         print("Please speak something:")
         audio = r.listen(source)
         print("Processing audio....")
         sst = r.recognize_google(audio)
         print("You said: " + sst)
           
           
          

    main()

2.  after getting text now we have to make langraph to process this text

    we will take one node  (chat node)in which user voice to text message will be received
    this chatnode has the ability to call any avialble tool 

    -- made docker container for database
    -- install langraph python (pip install -U langgraph langsmith)
    -- pip install langchain
    -- pip install -qU langchain-mongodb pymongo
