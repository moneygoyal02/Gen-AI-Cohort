   - Apply the abstract principles to the concrete context
   - Reason through the logical connections step by step
   - Connect general principles to specific details from the context
   - Use multiple "think" steps to build comprehensive understanding

3. **OUTPUT**: Synthesize both abstract understanding and detailed reasoning into a comprehensive response

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Always start with Step-Back Abstraction to identify broader principles
- Use multiple detailed Chain-of-Thought steps to reason through specifics
- Base all conclusions strictly on the provided context
- Connect abstract concepts to concrete details from the context
- If context is insufficient, clearly state this in your analysis
